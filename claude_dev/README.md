## Overview
Building a Tic Tac Toe game using Claude Dev, and Sonnet 3.5 model. Without having to write a single line of code 

## Files
- tic_tac_toe.py- game which is generated by the first prompt, allowing us to play on CLI
- tic_tac_toe_gui.py - game generated using the second prompt, which builds on top of the code generated by the first prompt, this iteration of the game will allow us to play the game on an GUI rather than CLI.

## Prompts:

Prompt 1:
    I want to build a tic toe game using python, the game will have 3 difficulty levels, easy medium and hard, before we start a game we will aks a user to mention which dificulty they would like to play with.

Prompt 2:
