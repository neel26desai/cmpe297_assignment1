# DeployWizard - Business Plan Executive Summary

## Company Overview
DeployWizard is a cutting-edge tech startup that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate and streamline the deployment of machine learning models in cloud environments.

## Problem
The deployment of ML models in cloud environments often requires extensive expertise in containerization, infrastructure as code (IaC), and cloud-specific deployment strategies. This complexity can slow down development cycles and hinder productivity, particularly for students and DevOps teams.

## Solution
DeployWizard offers an AI-powered assistant that automates the generation of:
1. Containerization scripts
2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
3. Detailed, cloud-specific deployment instructions

Our tool minimizes the time spent on researching deployment strategies, allowing users to focus on innovation rather than configuration.

## Market Opportunity
The global MLOps market is projected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2021 to $4 billion by 2025 (MarketsandMarkets). Our target segments include:
- Data scientists and ML engineers
- DevOps professionals transitioning to MLOps
- Educational institutions and students in ML/AI programs

## Competitive Advantage
- Unique combination of LLM and RAG technologies
- Adaptability to multiple cloud platforms and ML frameworks
- Focus on user-friendly interface and explanations
- Continuous learning and improvement through user feedback

## Business Model
